I don't know what open AI's plans are either. Yeah, there's always fun projects basically. And stable diffusion also is opening up a huge amount of experimentation. I would say in the visual realm and generating images and videos and movies. I'll think like videos now. And so that's going to be pretty crazy. That's going to almost certainly work and it's going to be really interesting when the cost of content creation is going to fall to zero. You used to need a painter for a few months to paint a thing and now it's going to be speak to your phone to get your video. So Hollywood will start using it to generate scenes, which completely opens up. Yeah, so you can make a movie like Avatar eventually for under a million dollars. Much less. Maybe just by talking to your phone. I mean, I know it sounds kind of crazy. And then there'd be some voting mechanism. Like how do you have a, like, would there be a show on\"),\n",

And then there was a little bit of learning on top of it, like a support vector machine or binary classifier for cat versus dog and images on top of the features. So we wrote the features, but we trained the last layer sort of the classifier. And then people are like, actually let's not even design the features because we can't honestly, we're not very good at it. So let's also learn the features. And then you end up with basically a convolution on your own where you're learning most of it. You're just specifying the architecture. And the architecture has tons of filling blanks, which is all the knobs. And you let the optimization write most of it. And so this transition is happening across the industry everywhere.

They're kind of on track to become these oracles. I could sort of think of it that way. They are oracles currently is just text, but they will have calculators, they will have access to Google search, they will have all kinds of gadgets and gizmos, they will be able to operate the internet and find different information. And yeah, in some sense, that's kind of like currently what it looks like in terms of the development.
